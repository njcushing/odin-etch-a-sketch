# odin-etch-a-sketch
An 'etch-a-sketch' page that allows the user to 'draw' to the
grid by hovering their cursor over the div elements in the grid.

Also contains a reset button to clear the grid, a resize button which
allows the user to increase or decrease the grid size in both axes,
and a colour mode button with three options: 'White to Black',
'Fade to Black' (where the first 10 squares have an increasing darkness
until each square filled becomes fully black) and 'Random Colour'.
